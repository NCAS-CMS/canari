# u-cv830

* 19500101
  storm_analysis failed due to deleted pt files. Forgot to add graph fix to suite.rc, now fixed.
* 19531001
  monitor task failed because 1 file (cv830i_4_mon_19531001-19531101.nc) had incorrect metadata which caused the file aggregation to not work correctly. The file metadata should have been updated by the modify_netcdf_metadata task but it didn't work correctly. Archer2 was having problems at the time so that was probably what caused the error to happen.
* 19580101
  Run abandoned because of a problem writing ocean metadata in modify_netcdf_metadata task, rerun from begining in suite u-cw356
