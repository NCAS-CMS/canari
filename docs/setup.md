## Setting up the CANARI suite

* Checkout the suiteid you've been assigned.  (rosie checkout u-c????
* In suite.rc file - adapt `TRANSFER_DIR `to point to your JASMIN Transfer cache directory.
* Double check that -> modify_netcdf_metadata -> model metadata -> all agrees with the spreadsheet. You shouldnâ€™t have to do anything though.
* Run the suite for 3 months see below.

## Running the suite

* `rose suite-run`. This will submt the suite and only run the first cycle; holding subsequent cycles highlighted in pink.
* Right click on the jdma task in the cylc GUI and select hold.
* Contact Reinhard when the first cycle coupled task has completed
* Assuming all the tasks have completed succcesfully and you've got the go ahead to continue the run. Release the suite by running `cylc release <suiteid>`
 
## Documenting the running suite

* Create a new page on the CANARI github site.
